"""Keeps the live meeting's notes up to date: every ~45 s with new speech, one Ling call sends the
current notes plus the new lines and gets the notes back as JSON, rewriting only the last topics; a
final pass rewrites them over the whole transcript when the meeting ends (a long meeting in parts,
merged). A failed or odd reply never replaces good notes.
The prompt and parsing are the Mac's (Notes.swift, via the Windows and Android ports), so every
platform writes the same notes."""
